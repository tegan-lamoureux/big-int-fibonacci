# Big Integer Fibonacci Calculator
Standard Fibonacci calculator with a custom 1024 byte integer type.  

Will calculate the n<sup>th</sup> value of the series, or all values from 0 to the n<sup>th</sup> value. Also contains a class `big_int` which serves as a 1024 byte integer, for holding larger results from calculation. `big_int` can scale up or down in size as needed.  

This was mainly an exercise in writing a diy "big number" class.
